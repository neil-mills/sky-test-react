# Sky React technical test

The work i have committed took approx 2 hours to complete.
I have completed the requested functionality, but due to the time constraints of the test I have only had time to implement basic ui styling.

## Tech choices

- As directed, I have installed create-react-app as a base for the project.
- I have used react-router as a dependency to develop the pagination history functionality
- I have utilised React context to manage the global state of the app.
- I have used stateless functional components and hooks where possible.
- I have chosen to use styled-components as a dependency. This keeps all css scoped to each component and removes any styling conflicts.
- I have imported Polished normalize to reset CSS global styling

## Running the app

To run the app, `cd` to the root of the project, and run `npm run start`. The app will run on http://localhost:3000.

## To do

If I was allowed additional time to develop the app further, i would:

- Fix issue with font-face using styled-components
- Build the UI mobile first
- Enhance the UI utilising the Sky toolkit.
- Scroll the page up to top of latest results when using pagination.
- UI Browser testing
